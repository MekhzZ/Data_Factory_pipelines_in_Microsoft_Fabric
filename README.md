# Data Factory pipelines in Microsoft Fabric

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing my hands-on experience with Data pipeline in Microsoft Fabric, as part of my learning journey on the Microsoft Learn platform. During this learning process, I explored the ETL(Extract, Transform & Load) process with Microsoft Fabric, focusing on data accuracy and consistency.

Additionally, Iâ€™ve included a certificate of completion to highlight my achievement in the module.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Demonstrates practical examples of data pipeline using Microsoft Fabric. Key operations include:
- Copy Data function to seemlessly Copy data from Http into Lakehouse
- Reading data with Spark DataFrames
- Transforming data with Spark SQL
- Completion Certificate: A PDF documenting the completion of the module.

## Key Learnings
- How to use Data pipeline to automate any chain of activities.
- Building ETL pipepline with low-no-code technique.
- Leveraging Microsoft Fabric for an integrated big data and analytics experience.
